# Customized-Coding-Schemes

Designed generic trees based on composite patterns. The encoding and decoding mechanism is analogous to symbol -> code dictionary. This application supports only prefix coding schemes and the decoding process could be done with any number of encoding symbols.

The tree structure has the actual data at the leaf nodes and the intermediate nodes direct to the respective leaf node for the given encoded message.

This application supports the following functionalities:
- Add a code-symbol pair to the coding tree
- Take in an encoded message and decode it
- Get the list of all the codes supported by this tree structure
- Check if the tree is complete
